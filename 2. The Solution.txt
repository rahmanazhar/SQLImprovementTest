Logical solutions to current query:
    - The renaming of columns is unnecessary
    - Joining unused table is unnecessary and it is contributing to longer time query because of the SELECT doesn't require the table to be output.
    - Using multiple WHERE conditions causes the query taking longer time, especially when using the LIKE '%%' operator that require to scan all the data tables.
    - Using multiple WHERE conditions on unused joined table is unnecessary.
    - Using conditions on INNER JOIN table instead of combining with the main table condition query
